Welcome to the Structured Rapid Development Toolkit!

The Standards and Practices team created this toolkit because we know how tough deadlines can be. We've built a library of easy-to-use design patterns to make your work easier and uphold our mission of "Empowering Excellence".

No more starting from scratch every time! These patterns will feel like second nature to you because they are based on Instructional Design best practices, like backward design and universal design for learning.

This toolkit includes:

1. **Components** - These are the building blocks of our curriculum, things like Lessons, Competencies, and Courses. This documentation explains what is required for each of these pieces to meet our quality standards.

2. **Design Patterns** - These tools help turn your design ideas into strategies and documents quickly. 

Just remember, you need to have your competencies written before using Structured Rapid Development. Once you've got your competencies, you can start planning your assessments and learning experiences.
