A pathway is a structured educational route designed to lead learners to specific skills, knowledge, or qualifications. It is defined by a series of [competencies](/components/competencies) â€” clearly articulated statements of what a learner should know and be able to do.
Pathways include degree programs and micro-credentials. Although WGU is investing in developing the technology required to offer a more fully personalized experience, we currently define a "Standard Path" for each pathway, which indicates the preferred sequence of courses and competencies.
