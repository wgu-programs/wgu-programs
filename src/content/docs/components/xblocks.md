An XBlock in Open edX (OEX) is a software component that adds new functionality to the Open edX platform. XBlocks are the building blocks used to create courses in Open edX. They can encompass a wide variety of content and interactive components, such as videos, quizzes, discussions, and other rich media. The modularity and flexibility of XBlocks allow course creators to integrate diverse content types into their courses, offering a more dynamic and interactive learning experience.

Each XBlock is a self-contained piece of code that works seamlessly within the Open edX platform. They can be developed independently, and once installed in an Open edX instance, they can be reused across multiple courses. This architecture allows educators and developers to extend the capabilities of Open edX and create customized learning experiences tailored to their specific needs.

We have the following types of XBlocks at WGU.
